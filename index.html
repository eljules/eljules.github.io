        <div class="content-text-container">
            <p class="content-text middle right dark-bg">Over the past several years our country has been experiencing a
                rise in the mental health crisis. This has led to an increase of alcohol consumption, substance abuse,
                and suicide. It was observed that before the pandemic, “Deaths from suicide, drug overdose, and
                alcohol-related liver disease, eclipsed the combined mortality of all infectious diseases combined in
                the United States.” (Magoon et al., 2020) There are many reasons for this overall decline in mental
                health, but the most predominant reason is a general lack of education and skills which are needed to
                deal with anxiety and depression.</p>

        <div class="content-text-container">
            <div class="content-text center middle dark-bg">
                <p>Because the skills needed to overcome depression and anxiety rely on a fair amount access to
                    resources
                    and education, the lower class—particularly minorities—tend to be impacted by this the most. One
                    study
                    noted that,</p><br>
                <p class="quote">
                    Of course, mental health, like physical health, does not exist in a vacuum. When people’s basic
                    needs
                    are met, they are healthier in mind and body… Being poor is bad for your health. This certainly
                    holds
                    true in New York City, where black and Latinx people are disproportionately vulnerable to the
                    coronavirus. (Magoon et al., 2020)

        <div class="content-text-container">
            <p class="content-text middle left light-bg">Aside from the lower class, anxiety and depression also have
                been taking a toll on the older generation of Americans. These generations tend to experience more
                anxiety and depression due to a lack of human connection, failing health, and growing separation from
                their loved ones. This generally goes unnoticed and untreated in our society. As a result, suicide is
                relatively high in this demographic of Americans. A study on the implications of the current pandemic
                stated that, “In 2018, older adults accounted for nearly one out of five suicide deaths (9,102 out of
                48,344) in the U.S.” (Panchal et al., 2020) </p>

            <p class="content-text bottom right light-bg">The amount of attention and action in regard to the mental
                health of these demographics was very limited before the rise of COVID-19. As a result, the issue has
                grown out of proportion and has begun to affect far more than just the aforementioned groups. </p>

    <div class="parallax-window content-window" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="/img/lockdown1.jpg">
        <div class="content-text-container">
            <p class="content-text middle left light-bg">The rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, and policy trying to curb
                the extent of its effect, has proved to be the catalyst of anxiety and depression for many Americans.
                Government mandated lockdowns have caused many people to lose their jobs and have caused people in the
                older generation to be more isolated amongst other things. Varying information in regard to protecting
                the vulnerable population has also proved to be a great source of stress and anxiety for many people.
                All of this ironically increased the influence of the pandemic to greatly affect those who have not
                caught the virus. However, since most efforts have been made to stop the virus and treat those who have
                contracted it, little to no effort has been made to help the many who are vulnerable to anxiety and
                depression. As a result of attention not being brought to the issue of increased anxiety and depression
                in the population, people generally did not have the knowledge or skills to properly cope with it during
                the pandemic. One study group found that, “Many adults are also reporting specific negative impacts on
                their mental health and wellbeing, such as difficulty sleeping (36%) or eating (32%), increases in
                alcohol consumption or substance use (12%), and worsening chronic conditions (12%), due to worry and
                stress over the coronavirus.” (Panchal et al., 2020)</p>

        <div class="content-text-container">
            <p class="content-text middle left dark-bg">One of the main contributors to this problem an increase of
                social media use while people are socially isolating. When looking at impact of social media during this
                crisis, one study indicated that “Because of widespread dissemination of unverified or downright fake
                reports that confuse the public…millions of individuals are relying heavily on social media while
                sheltering in place. There is growing concern that this trend may result in increased risk of depressed
                mood, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental health problems” (Magoon et al., 2020) Because people are isolated
                from others, they rely on social media to know the general condition of society. There are many stories
                and articles about the pandemic, amongst other things, which can spread a dark and twisted depiction of
                reality. People who consistently come across these skewed depictions tend to experience more anxiety and
                depression the more often they come into contact with them. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="parallax-window content-window" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="/img/elderly4.jpg">
        <div class="content-text-container">
            <p class="content-text middle right dark-bg">Because the older generation is more vulnerable to the virus,
                current social distancing practices and policies tend to leave them more isolated. It was observed that
                a lot of current government lock down policies, “may limit [the older generation’s] interactions with
                caregivers and loved ones, which could lead to increased feelings of loneliness and anxiety, in addition
                to general feelings of uncertainty and fear due to the pandemic.” (Panchal et al., 2020) This increased
                effort to protect their effort can also prove to be detrimental to their health when taken to the
                extreme. Isolation along with fear of the virus turns into a perfect storm of stress and anxiety. This
                turns into deep depression because these people are isolated from resources to help them cope during
                these troubled times. This may even lead to suicide in some cases where these people go too long without
                being treated or followed up on. </p>

                “Public education will be an essential tool for conveying accurate information about the role of
                lifestyle for enhancing emotional and mental wellness.” (Magoon et al., 2020)
            </p>
            <p class="content-text middle right light-bg">
                The greatest way we can help this issue is by educating people on lifestyle changes and strategies which
                help counteract the negative effects of anxiety and depression. Learning to overcoming depression and
                anxiety is not an easy task, but it is certainly possible when we empower the people with proper
                knowledge on how to do it. This can be best done when programs are organized to help educate the people.
                It was noted that “Carried out at a community level and coordinated by volunteers, such programs will
                achieve maximum buy-in and can probably be planned and implemented at little or no cost.” (Magoon et
                al., 2020) By mobilizing in communities to best educate each other on how to battle the mental
                repercussions of COVID-19, we can help many people be healthier and happier. It could even save lives.

                “Since media reports can be emotionally disturbing, contact with pandemic-related news should be
                monitored and limited.” (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020) </p>
            <p class="content-text middle right dark-bg">
                Social media also plays a key role in reducing the effect of anxiety and depression. The groups which
                are assembled to educate the community should teach people how to effectively monitor and limit their
                social media use. By separating from these platforms, people tend to find greater ability to cope with
                the pandemic. A study claimed that, “Social media interventions have been proven effective for changing
                perceptions and behaviors on a large scale, and may become an important part of a coordinated national
                strategy for psychoeducation and enhancing resilience in the face of COVID-19.” (Magoon et al., 2020)
                Though people may not realize it, social media can have a more negative impact on their health and
                happiness. This is why it is essential that we incorporate education on the effects of social media
                during community trainings.

            <p class="content-text middle center dark-bg">Though COVID-19 has exacerbated the mental health crisis in
                America. It is a problem that should be taken as seriously as the pandemic itself. If people continue to
                ignore this issue, it is projected that there will be up to an additional 75,000 deaths from suicide and
                addiction which stems from untreated anxiety and depression. (Magoon et al., 2020) This issue will be
                best treated as we form programs on the community level to educate people on how to properly treat
                themselves and others who are experiencing anxiety and depression. </p>
